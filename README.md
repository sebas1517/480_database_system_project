# Startup page
Login page has select option for: admin/nurse/patient

# Implementation Ideas
Figure out what works best SQL/XAMPP(PHP)/Front-end(HTML) or SQL/DJango(Python)/Front-end(HTML)

Front-end:
layout webpage

Back-end:
Items we will need to compose the back-end that will work with the HTML
1. A Web server (i.e. Apache).

2. PHP, configured to interpret scripts that are part of the documents handled by the Web server.

3. An SQL database server (i.e., MySQL).
